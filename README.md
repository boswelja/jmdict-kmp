# JMDict-KMP

Kotlin Multiplatform, pre-packaged Japanese-Multilingual dictionary!

All dictionary-related data comes from [The JMDict Project](https://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html), huge shoutout to them for making this possible!

Currently we have full support for Android targets, and partial support for JVM targets. iOS and native are coming soon!
